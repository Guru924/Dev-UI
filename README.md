## Features

- **Accurate UI Cloning**: Each clone is a precise recreation of the visual design of the original website/app.
- **Responsive Design**: UIs adapt to different screen sizes for an optimal experience across devices.
- **Component-Based Architecture**: All clones are built using reusable components for better structure and maintainability.
- **Modern Frontend Technologies**: Focus on using up-to-date tools like React, Vite, and CSS modules.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **Vite**: Fast build tool for modern web development
- **CSS3**: For styling and layout
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For interactivity and logic

## Available UI Clones

Here are some of the UI clones currently available in this repository:

- **Clone 1**: [Twiter] - A fully responsive clone of the homepage.


## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js** (LTS version recommended): [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Git**: [Download here](https://git-scm.com/)
- A code editor like **VS Code**: [Download here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ui-clones.git

   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**

   Move into the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd ui-clones
      ```

3. **Install dependencies**

    Install all the required packages using npm (or yarn if preferred):
   ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    This will install all the dependencies listed in the package.json file.

4. **Start the development server**

    After installing the dependencies, start the development server using Vite:
     ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    This will launch the app on a local server, and you can view it in the browser.

5. **Open in the browser**

    By default, Vite runs on http://localhost:3000. You can open this link in your browser to see the available UI clones.
    
    http://localhost:3000

6. **Explore the UI clones**

    Once the development server is running, you can navigate through the different UI clones by following the links provided on the home page or manually visiting the routes specified for each clone.

7. **Building for Production**

    To build the project for production, run:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    This will bundle the application and output static files to the dist directory, which can then be deployed to any web server.

8. **Running Tests**
    If you have any unit or integration tests in the project, you can run them with:
    ```bash
    npm test
    ```
    This will execute all the available tests and display the results in your terminal.

    That's it! Now you're all set to start developing or testing the UI clones locally.
